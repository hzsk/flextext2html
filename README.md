# flextext2html

This XSL is used to generate visualizations from FLEXTEXT files. Some examples can be seen [here](https://inel.corpora.uni-hamburg.de/?page_id=652) and [here](https://inel.corpora.uni-hamburg.de/?page_id=649). The result is not final and further sophistication in the tool is needed if there is will to use it directly with other file formats such as EXB.

The XSL was written by Niko Partanen while working in [INEL project](https://inel.corpora.uni-hamburg.de). Visualization uses [Leipzig.js](http://bdchauvette.net/leipzig.js/) JavaScript library created by Benjamin Chauvette.
